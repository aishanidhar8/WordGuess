**Name - Word Guessing Game**

**Description -** It is a fun and interactive web application where the players are challenged to guess a word within a limited number of attempts, with real-time feedback provided after each guess to guide them towards the correct answer and to enhance gameplay experience.
Five-letter word guessing game. The rules for this game are simple. The game tells you if the letters you picked are in the word and if they are in the right place as well. If the letter is in the right spot, it shows up green, and a correct letter in the wrong spot shows up yellow. A letter that isnâ€™t present in the word at all becomes inactive and shows up grey in colour.
The Ui presents a board of 6 rows and 5 columns, which means we have 6 chances to guess the 5-letter word.

- Random Word Generation: A new random word is selected for each game, ensuring a unique and engaging experience every time.
- User Input and Feedback: Players can enter their guesses via an intuitive user interface, receiving immediate feedback on the correctness of their guesses.
- Limited Attempts: Players have a set number of attempts to guess the word correctly, adding an element of challenge and strategy to the game.
